Fluent Validation is a helper package, that allows you to use sensible defaults for your Laravel validation rules.

## Installation

```bash
composer require juststeveking/fluent-validation
```

## Why??

Why did I create this package? Well to be honest, I was feeling lazy - but a productive kind of lazy. I was writing some validation for quite a large API request and looked at all the string input I was about to have to validate, and thought there must be an easier way. So I created this to save me time by taking time building a package. I got the last laugh though, as now I never have to write the same string validation again!

## Usage

To use this package all you need to do is include the rules you may wish to use:

### Validating emails

```php
return [
    'email' => \JustSteveKing\FluentValidation\Fluency\EmailRule::rules()
];
```

Or to build them up yourself and/or override them:

```php
return [
    'email' => [
        \JustSteveKing\FluentValidation\Rules\Required::rule(),
        \JustSteveKing\FluentValidation\Rules\Email::rule('rfc,dns'),
    ]
];
```

### Validating Passwords

```php
return [
    'password' => \JustSteveKing\FluentValidation\Fluency\PasswordRule::rules()
];
```

Or to build them up yourself and/or override them:

```php
return [
    'password' => [
        \JustSteveKing\FluentValidation\Rules\Required::rule(),
        \Illuminate\Validation\Rules\Password::default(),
    ]
];
```

### Validating Strings

```php
return [
    'title' => \JustSteveKing\FluentValidation\Fluency\StringRule::rules()
];
```

Or to build them up yourself and/or override them:

```php
return [
    'title' => [
        \JustSteveKing\FluentValidation\Rules\Required::rule(),
        \JustSteveKing\FluentValidation\Rules\Text::rule(),
        \JustSteveKing\FluentValidation\Rules\Min::rule(2),
        \JustSteveKing\FluentValidation\Rules\Max::rule(255),
    ]
];
```
